# cookbook (aka currently unnamed project)

This is a side project I have been working on slowly. It's a website for creating a "cookbook" (or multiple "cookbooks") and you can add your friends as "contributors". Then all of you have access to recipes you might all love and can easily share new ones. Alternatively, it could be used for online storage of recipes for an individual user.

### Todo
- Create better seeds
- Add "substitution" migration
- Implement Syndra
- Redo current JavaScript (for the create recipe page)
- Continue front-end design/development
- Figure out image stuff (mainly for view recipe page)
- Figure out pivot tables (attach/detach)
- Continue work in the controllers
- Add features such as variations, substitutions, etc
- Implement an import recipe function
